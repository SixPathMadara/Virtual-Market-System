# Introduction

The community of foreign exchange trading has grown vastly. The earliest beginning dates back to the Babylonian period when trading through the barter system was practiced as a means of exchange. "At its core, forex trading is about capturing the changing value of pairs of currencies. For example, if you think the Euro will increase or decrease against the U.S Dollar, a speculator might buy or sell the Euros with Dollars"(Investopedia). The initial recognition of forex trading in South Africa began between the late 1990s and early 2000s, to which the governments act of liberation to the economy sparked an the interest of local investors to participate in this activity. This government act gave way for brokers to create platforms for individuals to be able to trade currencies.

# Current System

There is a vast number of broker platforms that allow individuals to trade currencies but there is only a handful of systems that allow traders to share their ideas, e.g Tradingview.com. But such systems still have limit on how much traders can share data with each other.

# Problem statement

Currently, Traders use external applications as a means of sharing trading analysis and results such as WhatsApp or Telegram as many or all trading platforms only have a limit to the usage of sharing data, to which some give premiums for allowing data to be shared. The trading community is currently struggling to create a trust between traders as many only give out their trading signals for premiums and cannot verify their shared signals using those external apps. It is even becoming more of a big issue as many people have been scammed out of buying signals that have been used and cannot be verified if they are truly the original authors analysis or the analysis was not tempered with.

# Problem solution

The proposed solution is to build a system that allows traders to publish trading signals that are open to all citizens and allow them to share their ideas and results together within a specific currency pair group. The system will allow users to proof read and check the analysis of other traders and can be used to promote the trust amongst the trading community. The system will allow users to participate in other traders analysis and can allow users to create open communities amongst each other.
